## Aim 
This project aims to run AI on analog circuit by replicating neural network with analog circuit.

## Neuron
![Neuron](README\Neural.jpg)
A Neuron takes in N number of input and multiply the value with their respective weights then adds up all the value and goes thru an activation function and finally gives an output. 

## Neural Network 
![NeuralNet](README\NeuralNet.png)
A Neural Net consist of lots of neurons working together. There's 3 layers in a neural net. From left to right, Input Layer, Hidden Layer and Output Layer. Generally, There will be only one Input and Output layer with multiple Hidden Layer in between them. 

# Neuron Analog Accelerator
Because of how simple neuron works We can simulate it with analog circuits to reduce workload on digital processors. My design is as shown below.
